# Scally CSS framework presentation

A presentation built in: <https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js> for the
[Scally CSS framework](https://github.com/chris-pearce/scally).

## Ideas

### Structure

- How it came about?
- What is it?
	- Lego: bits and pieces to construct UI
	- OOCSS
	- Show Nicole Sullivans media object
	-	Responsive ready
- What its not
	- An all singing and all dancing UI component library
- Why use it?
	- CSS can suck
		- Anyone can write CSS, writing CSS is easy, architecting it isn’t
		- Everything is in the global scope
		- Show funny pic of Gandolf?
	- Without a proper architecture/system it’ll turn into a big pile of mud
	- Everything has its place:
		- Gives you an architecture
		- Shouldn’t be left wondering where something lives
	- Explain each layer (graphic of the 4 layers)
	- Unopinionated
	- Everything is configurable
	- Ensures consistency
	- Performant:
		-	Show file size
	- Makes things highly maintainable
- How to use it
	- Defer more work to the HTML

	- Acts as the foundation for all Campaign Monitor UI builds, we than have another layer on top which contains all Campaign Monitor specific styles
	- Examples:
		- Side-by-side
