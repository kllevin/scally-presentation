						<h1>How it came about?</h1>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Scally was created as an open source CSS framework for my old employer <a href="http://westfieldlabs.com" target="_blank">Westfield Labs</a>.</p>
						<p>It extended and nicely packaged up the CSS framework that I'd been developing and using over the many years working as a UI developer.</p>
						<p>The name&hellip;</p>

						<aside class="notes">
								<ul>
									<li>I was the lead front-end developer at Westfield Labs.</li>
									<li>I introduced my own CSS framework to build UI mainly the new AU responsive website.</li>
									<li>A year had gone by but the framework hadn't been updated so it was starting to feel neglected and lacked proper documentation.</li>
									<li>I proposed that we needed to develop a proper CSS framework, WF agreed. I worked on it full-time for around 3 months collaborating with the rest of the team along the way and doing a shit load research.</li>
									<li>Why roll your own? Inuit and SUIT CSS were the only 2 frameworks that came close to what I believed to be true OOCSS frameworks. Inuit was no longer being maintained and was showing it, and SUIT CSS used certain things in a way that I didn't quite agree with + it didn't use Sass.</li>
									<li>I decided to name it Scally, which was a suggestion by my former head of engineering and friend Ian Tinsley, who like me is an Englishman, which is why it got named Scally.</li>

						<p>Bits and pieces to construct UI.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Building blocks so Lego&trade; is the best analogy for Scally and I will show some examples later in the presentation.</li>
							</ol>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Scally is a collection of tiny, composable, configurable, interdependent modules that you can piece together how you want to, when you want to, giving you a solid, scalable CSS architecture.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>All HTML elements render as blocks and pretty much all UI layout can be handled by a bunch of CSS rules abstracted away into reusable modules, this is what Scally does.</li>
							</ul>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Key features</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Highly modular following <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/" target="_blank">OOCSS</a> principles.</li>
							<li>Light weight: <strong>37kb</strong> minified, <strong>14kb</strong> minified and gzipped.</li>
							<li>Responsive ready.</li>
							<li>Unopinionated about design.</li>
							<li>Uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> and <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/" target="_blank">BEM</a>.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>
									<ul>
										<li>In a nutshell OOCSS basically means a CSS “object” is a repeating visual pattern, that can be abstracted into an independent snippet of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. That object can then be reused throughout a site. This allows us to build large-scale UI's (or any UI's for that matter) in a fast, maintainable, and standards-based way.</li>
										<li>Two Main Principles of OOCSS:
											<ul>
												<li>Separate structure and skin <br>This means not mixing in cosmetics (like background and border styles) but instead only including the structural CSS, this ties into point #4.</li>
												<li>Separate container and content <br>Essentially, this means “rarely use location-dependent styles”. An object should look the same no matter where you put it. Descendant selectors are a rare thing when building UI this way.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Scally applies all of this, it's there when you need it and getting out of your way when you don't.</li>
										<li>I will show some examples later in the presentation.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Entire framework is 14kb gzipped however Scally allows you to only use what you need with the exception of the <strong>Core</strong> section therefore it can be as light as 6-8kb. This is a drop in the ocean compared to other site assets e.g. 1 jpeg can weigh anywhere between 20-100kb.</li>
								<li>Is responsive ready making building responsive UI's easy. They're no absolute units used in Scally e.g. <code>px</code>, everything is fluid. Scally lets you change UI at breakpoints e.g. a grid can be 6 columns at super wide viewports, 3 columns at medium width viewports, and zero columns and small width viewports like handheld devices. However Scally doesn't force you to go responsive, you can easily create fixed width UI's with Scally.</li>
								<li>Scally doesn't come with any design and everything is configurable. This approach means Scally acts as a solid foundation to your UI allowing you to layer on the cosmetic styles of the UI on top.</li>
								<li>BEM is a front-end naming methodology. It is a smart way of naming your CSS classes to give them more transparency and meaning to other developers.</li>

						<h1>What it's not</h1>
					</section>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>An all-singing all-dancing feature rich component library <em>à la</em> <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a>.</li>
							<li>A panacea for all UI builds. Scally doesn't try to be all things to all men, it does one job and one job well, then gets out of your way.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Personally I think frameworks have gone too far. Look at Bootstrap, it's not a framework, it's a theme off the shelf. Most frameworks usually do so much more than you actually need, are too bloated and way too prescriptive and opinionated. They can be good for prototyping but most project UI's are unique so you want something that leaves the theming (cosmetics) to you.</li>
								<li>Scally provides all the building blocks you need and leaves all the theming to you i.e. it doesn't get in your way.</li>
								<li>We can develop a Campaign Monitor version of Scally that sits above Scally and includes all of CM's styles, this is how we tackled it at Westfield.</li>

						<h2>The problems with CSS</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>It's old, really old.</li>
							<li>It operates in a global namespace.</li>
							<li>It's very, very loose.</li>
							<li>Source order is critical.</li>
							<li>Specificity negates the above.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>CSS started out styling the simplest of HTML documents. It's catching up with some impressive additions however it still lacks a lot.</li>
								<li>CSS is leaky as fuck! Things can get bloated and very non-DRY very quick.</li>
								<li>Forced to write CSS differently when it comes to following OOCSS principles, specificity needs to be as flat as possible.</li>
							</ul>

						<h2>Scally helps</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>By providing a solid architecture.</li>
							<li>By being unopinionated and highly configurable.</li>
							<li>By being performant (light-weight).</li>
							<li>By enabling rapid UI development.</li>
							<li>By ensuring UI's are consistent.</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>You should never have to wonder where something lives as everything has it's place. Meaning your CSS will be highly maintainable.</li>

						as a whole.</li>
						  <li><code class="token selector">.block--modifier</code> represents a different state or version of <code class="token selector">.block</code>.</li>

						<h2>The driving principle</h2>
						<blockquote>When I start a new project, I assume it will eventually be open sourced (even if it's unlikely). This mindset leads to effortless modularization. If you think about how other people outside your company might use your code, you become much less likely to bake in proprietary configuration details or tightly coupled interfaces. This, in turn, leads to cleaner, more maintainable code. Even internal code should pretend to be open source code.</blockquote>

						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>.</li>
								<li>Forces you to scrutinise over everything you do as every bit of Scally needs to work in a way that does one thing and one thing only. The open/closed principle.</li>
